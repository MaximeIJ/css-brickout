## A timeless favorite...

[Demo](https://maximeij.dev/css-brickout/)

CSS Brickout (sometimes typo'd as _CSS Breakout_) exposes a responsive, customizable, themable, extensible implementation of the beloved classic to the web. This 0 dependency library can be used in any ecosystem and framework.

### Quick start

No time for a chat, here's the copy pastable stuff:

```npm
npm i @maximeij/css-brickout
```

```typescript
import '@maximeij/css-brickout/css';
import {Game} from '@maximeij/css-brickout';
```

See [demo.ts](src/demo.ts) for a quick example of how to invoke it. Either have a div with id `game` rendered, or pass a custom `parentId` to the input object to target anything else.

## ...with a twist!

Unlike other web based games, this little number renders all its graphics with good old CSS. No `canvas` were hurt (or used) during the production. While this was initially more of a personal challenge for the love of CSS-art and other related endeavors, it has proven to bring some advantages.

### Easy themes ðŸŽ¨

With CSS Brickout, no need to wonder how hard it'll be to customize the feel and look of your game: it's as simple as tried and true `--css-variables`.
Anything not covered by that can be easily styled with static class names exposed by the lib:

```css
/* Example custom game container */
#custom-game {
  --ball-bg: hsl(98, 18, 89%);
  --paddle-bg: hsl(0, 0, 50%);
}

#custom-game .ball {
  border-style: double;
}
```

### Still though... CSS for 60 FPS?

Yep! There's really only thing moving at 60FPS (the balls), and positioning them and other objects in a way consistent with the underlying model is pretty straightforward:

```typescript
this.element.style.transform = `translateX(calc(${absX}px - 50%)) translateY(calc(${absY}px - 50%))`;
```

The movement of the ball is not very smooth and the game does consume more power than it would if using optimized graphics like `canvas` and `svg`. I plan to decouple the rendering logic so we can create a more efficient rendering method to compare just exactly how big is the difference with CSS is. In the meantime this is a fun experiment.
